# Glossary

**Bluetooth**: A wireless technology used for exchanging data over short distances between devices.

**Branch**: A parallel version of a repository that allows for separate development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

**Buffer**: A temporary storage area in memory used to hold data that is being transferred between two devices or processes.

**Bus protocols**: A set of rules governing data transfer between components in a computer system.

**Bus**: A communication pathway that enables devices to exchange data with each other and the CPU.

**Clock**: A signal that synchronizes the operations of different hardware components.

**Clock support configuration**: The settings that control the behavior of the system clock, which is used to synchronize the operation of various components of the computer system.

**Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to a repository at a specific point in time.

**CPU threshold**: The level of processing power at which a system will take a specific action or execute a particular task.

**Cryptography**: The practice of securing communication from adversaries by converting plain text into an unintelligible form.

**Device driver**: A software component that enables the communication between the operating system and a hardware device.

**Diffstat**: A tool used to show the changes made between two code revisions.

**DMA**: Direct Memory Access, a method for transferring data between devices without involving the CPU.

**Firmware**: A type of software that is stored on a hardware device and is responsible for controlling the device's functions.

**Glimpseindex**: An indexing mechanism used in the Glimpse search engine.

**Git**: A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

**Git Log**: A log of changes made to a repository using Git.

**Hardware tracing**: A technique for analyzing the behavior of a software program by monitoring hardware-level events in the computer system.

**I2C**: Inter-Integrated Circuit, a communication protocol used to connect low-speed peripherals with the CPU.

**Interrupt**: A signal sent to the CPU by a device to request its attention and initiate a response.

**Kernel**: The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources and provides common services for other programs.

**Makefile**: A script that automates the compilation and linking of source code into executable programs or libraries.

**Message passing**: A method of inter-process communication where processes communicate by sending and receiving messages.

**NFC**: Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication protocol used for exchanging data between two devices in close proximity.

**Patch**: A file containing changes to a source code file or set of files, typically used to fix bugs or add features.

**Polling**: A method used by a device driver to continuously check the status of a hardware device for new data.

**Power handling**: The management of a computer system's power usage, including power management features such as sleep and hibernation.

**Power Management**: The process of managing power consumption of hardware devices to optimize energy usage and extend battery life.

**Readme**: A file that contains important information about a project, such as installation instructions, usage guidelines, and licensing information.

**Release notes**: Documentation that accompanies a software release, describing new features, bug fixes, and known issues.

**Resource manipulation**: The process of managing system resources, such as memory or storage, to optimize performance and ensure efficient usage.

**ROM types**: The different types of Read-Only Memory (ROM) used in electronic devices, such as PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.

**Script**:  A set of instructions written in a programming language used to automate tasks or perform a specific function.

**Short log**: A summary of changes made to a repository, typically used to track progress or identify problems.

**Spinlock**: A synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources in a multi-threaded or multi-processor system.

**Staging**: An area of the Linux kernel where new or experimental code is placed for testing before it is integrated into the main kernel code.

**Subsystem**: A component of the Linux kernel that provides specific functionality, such as memory management or networking.

**Tag**: A label applied to a specific commit in a Git repository, typically used to mark a milestone or release.
