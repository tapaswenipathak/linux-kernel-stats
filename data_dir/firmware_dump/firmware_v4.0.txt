    This patches introduce two kernel APIs of cache_firmware and

    in situations which can't request firmware from user space.
    firmware loader: always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer
    This patch always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer allocated
    inside firmware_data_write, and add all instances of firmware_buf
    into the firmware cache global list. Also introduce one private field
    in 'struct firmware', so release_firmware will see the instance of
    firmware_buf associated with the current firmware instance, then just
    'free' the instance of firmware_buf.
    The firmware_buf instance represents one pages buffer for one
    firmware image, so lots of firmware loading requests can share
    the same firmware_buf instance if they request the same firmware
    This patch will make implementation of the following cache_firmware/
    uncache_firmware very easy and simple.
    In fact, the patch improves request_formware/release_firmware:
            - only request userspace to write firmware image once if
            several devices share one same firmware image and its drivers
            call request_firmware concurrently.

    This patch introduces struct firmware_buf to describe the buffer
    which holds the firmware data, which will make the following
    cache_firmware/uncache_firmware implemented easily.
    firmware loader: fix creation failure of fw loader device
    If one device driver calls request_firmware_nowait() to request
    several different firmwares' loading, device_add() will return

    device who is requesting firmware.

    trying to load it without firmware files present. After looking closely

    when request_firmware fails, this is a change of behaviour of the code
