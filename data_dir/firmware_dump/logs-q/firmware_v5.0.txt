    rtw88: decide lps deep mode from firmware feature.
    This patch checks the supported lps deep mode from firmware feature,
    and allows different firmware have different deep power mode.
    rtw88: add C2H response for checking firmware leave lps
    Originally driver checks if firmware has left lps via reading the setting
    of REG_TCR register. But this way may fail when firmware is frequently
    changing power state. Therefore, firmware provides a safer option for
    driver. When firmware leaves lps successfully, it sends a C2H response
    rtw88: store firmware feature in firmware header
    Some functions need the support of firmware with special version.
    In order to get the feature of current firmware, we store the information
    in firmware header and parse after firmware is loaded. The current feature
    list in firmware header includes checking leave lps via C2H and
    rtw88: sync the power state between driver and firmware
    In current flow, driver issues power requests to firmware for entering or
    leaving deep power mode. But driver does not wait for an ack from firmware
    The behavior will lead to unsynchronized state between firmware and driver.
    Furthermore, consecutive same power requests may confuse firmware and leads
    request will wait for an ack from firmware and only send one power request

    or not), the driver should do a firmware reset when it gets -EAGAIN in
    Many drivers load the device's firmware image during the initialization

    firmware: introduce device_cache/uncache_fw_images
    so we can use device_cache_fw_images() to cache firmware for
    all devices which need firmware to work, and the device driver
    can get the firmware easily from kernel memory when system isn't
    ready for completing requests of loading firmware.
    After system is ready for completing firmware loading, driver core
    the cached firmware.
    The above helpers will be used to cache device firmware during
    The firmware loader will use the API to get each firmware name
    firmware loader: store firmware name into devres list
    This patch will store firmware name into devres list of the device
    which is requesting firmware loading, so that we can implement
    auto cache and uncache firmware for devices in need.
    firmware loader: fix comments on request_firmware_nowait
    request_firmware_nowait is allowed to be called in atomic
    firmware loader: fix device lifetime

    call request_firmware* in its probe() or open(), so the constraint
    schedule_work() in request_firmware_nowait() to avoid that
    the @device is released after request_firmware_nowait returns
    firmware loader: introduce cache_firmware and uncache_firmware
    This patches introduce two kernel APIs of cache_firmware and
    uncache_firmware, both of which take the firmware file name
    So any drivers can call cache_firmware to cache the specified
    firmware file into kernel memory, and can use the cached firmware
    in situations which can't request firmware from user space.
    firmware loader: always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer
    This patch always let firmware_buf own the pages buffer allocated
    inside firmware_data_write, and add all instances of firmware_buf
    into the firmware cache global list. Also introduce one private field
    in 'struct firmware', so release_firmware will see the instance of
    firmware_buf associated with the current firmware instance, then just
    'free' the instance of firmware_buf.
    The firmware_buf instance represents one pages buffer for one
    firmware image, so lots of firmware loading requests can share
    the same firmware_buf instance if they request the same firmware
    This patch will make implementation of the following cache_firmware/
    uncache_firmware very easy and simple.
    In fact, the patch improves request_formware/release_firmware:
            - only request userspace to write firmware image once if
            several devices share one same firmware image and its drivers
            call request_firmware concurrently.
    firmware loader: introduce firmware_buf
    This patch introduces struct firmware_buf to describe the buffer
    which holds the firmware data, which will make the following
    cache_firmware/uncache_firmware implemented easily.
    firmware loader: fix creation failure of fw loader device
    If one device driver calls request_firmware_nowait() to request
    several different firmwares' loading, device_add() will return
    failure since all firmware loader device use same name of the
    device who is requesting firmware.
    This patch always use the name of firmware image as the firmware
    for caching firmware will make sure only one loading for same
    firmware is alllowd at the same time.
    firmware loader: remove unnecessary wmb()
    firmware loader: fix races during loading firmware
    This patch fixes two races in loading firmware:
    on _request_firmware_load, otherwise FW_STATUS_ABORT may be

    to prevent pages' buffer completed from being freed in firmware_loading_store.

    V4L/DVB (6646): xc2028: rework firmware (re)loading process
    Define a list of valid "firmware types" for each combination of BASE,
    DTV and SCODEs.  By masking the appropriate firmware bits off we can
    just use one "type" for the firmware searching and also flag when we
    are looking for a BASE, DTV or SCODE type firmware.  This makes it
    individual firmware part.
    Add a structure to remember what firmware properties we have.  This
    contains the currently loaded/wanted  base firmware (type), video std
    When checking whether the current firmware needs to be reloaded, first
    figure out exactly what "type" of firmware we want (base, std and
