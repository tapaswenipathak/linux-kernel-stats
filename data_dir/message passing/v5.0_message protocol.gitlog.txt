    Input: imx_sc_key - only take the valid data from SCU firmware as key state
    
    When reading key state from SCU, the response data from SCU firmware
    is 4 bytes due to MU message protocol, but ONLY the first byte is the
    key state, other 3 bytes could be some dirty data, so we should ONLY
    take the first byte as key state to avoid reporting incorrect state.

    The scmi-cpufreq driver calls the arch_set_freq_scale() callback on
    frequency changes to provide scale-invariant load-tracking signals to
    the scheduler. However, in the slow path, it does so while specifying
    the current and max frequencies in different units, hence resulting in a

    Fix this by passing all frequencies in KHz, as stored in the CPUFreq

    firmware: add Intel Stratix10 service layer driver
    
    Some features of the Intel Stratix10 SoC require a level of privilege
    higher than the kernel is granted. Such secure features include
    FPGA programming. In terms of the ARMv8 architecture, the kernel runs
    at Exception Level 1 (EL1), access to the features requires
    Exception Level 3 (EL3).
    
    The Intel Stratix10 SoC service layer provides an in kernel API for
    drivers to request access to the secure features. The requests are queued
    and processed one by one. ARM’s SMCCC is used to pass the execution
    of the requests on to a secure monitor (EL3).
    
    The header file stratix10-sve-client.h defines the interface between
    service providers (FPGA manager is one of them) and service layer.
    
    The header file stratix10-smc.h defines the secure monitor call (SMC)
    message protocols used for service layer driver in normal world
    (EL1) to communicate with secure monitor SW in secure monitor exception
    level 3 (EL3).

    Merge tag 'scmi-updates-4.17' of ssh://gitolite.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sudeep.holla/linux into next/drivers
    
    Pull "ARM SCMI support for v4.17" from Sudeep Holla:
    
    ARM System Control and Management Interface(SCMI)[1] is more flexible and
    easily extensible than any of the existing interfaces.
    
    Few existing as well as future ARM platforms provide micro-controllers
    to abstract various power and other system management tasks which have
    similar interfaces, both in terms of the functions that are provided by
    them, and in terms of how requests are communicated to them.
    
    There are quite a few protocols like ARM SCPI, TI SCI, QCOM RPM, Nvidia Tegra
    BPMP, and so on already. This specification is to standardize and avoid any
    further fragmentation in the design of such interface by various vendors.
    
    The current SCMI driver implementation is very basic and initial support.
    It lacks support for notifications, asynchronous/delayed response, perf/power
    statistics region and sensor register region.
    
    Mailbox is the only form of transport supported currently in the driver.
    SCMI supports interrupt based mailbox communication, where, on completion
    of the processing of a message, the caller receives an interrupt as well as
    polling for completion.
    
    SCMI is designed to minimize the dependency on the mailbox/transport
    hardware. So in terms of SCMI, each channel in the mailbox includes
    memory area, doorbell and completion interrupt.
    
    However the doorbell and completion interrupt is highly mailbox dependent
    which was bit of controversial as part of SCMI/mailbox discussions.
    
    Arnd and me discussed about the few aspects of SCMI and the mailbox framework:
    
    1. Use of mailbox framework for doorbell type mailbox controller:
       - Such hardware may not require any data to be sent to signal the remote
         about the presence of a message. The channel will have in-built
         information on how to trigger the signal to the remote.
         There are few mailbox controller drivers which are purely doorbell based.
         e.g.QCOM IPC, STM, Tegra, ACPI PCC,..etc
    
    2. Supporting other mailbox controller:
       - SCMI just needs a mechanism to signal the remote firmware. Such
         controller may need fixed message to be sent to trigger a doorbell.
         In such case we may need to get that data from DT and pass the same
         to the controller. It's not covered in the current DT binding, but
         can be extended as optional property in future.
    
         However handling notifications may be interesting on such mailbox, but
         again there is no way to interpret what the data field(remote message)
         means, it could be a bit mask or a number or don't-care.
    
    Arnd mentioned that he doesn't like the way the mailbox binding deals
    with doorbell-type hardware, but we do have quite a few precedent drivers
    already and changing the binding to add a data field would not make it any
    better, but could cause other problems. So he is happy with the status quo
    of SCMI implementation.

    kvm/x86: Hyper-V SynIC message slot pending clearing at SINT ack
    
    The SynIC message protocol mandates that the message slot is claimed
    by atomically setting message type to something other than HVMSG_NONE.
    If another message is to be delivered while the slot is still busy,
    message pending flag is asserted to indicate to the guest that the
    hypervisor wants to be notified when the slot is released.
    
    To make sure the protocol works regardless of where the message
    sources are (kernel or userspace), clear the pending flag on SINT ACK
    notification, and let the message sources compete for the slot again.
