    powercap: add suspend and resume mechanism for SOC power limit
    
    PL1 and PL2 could be throlled or de-throttled by
    Thermal management to control SOC temperature.
    
    However, currently, their value will be reset to default value
    after once system suspend and resume.
    
    Add pm_notifier to save PL1, PL2 before system suspect and restore
    PL1, PL2 after system resume.

    Merge branch 'drm-nouveau-next' of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/nouveau/linux-2.6 into drm-next
    
    - Ilia's PMPEG improvements
    - MSI fixes, and another attempt at enabling by default
    - Initial GK208 support, just modesetting
    - "Old" PM code gone, new infrastructure and various different stages of support (depending which chipset / ram type etc) is in its place.  This includes support that goes beyond what the previous code was capable of.  User control has been deliberately sabotaged, it's not safe to use still.
    - Thermal management / fan control that's been present for a while is turned ON by default now.
    - Misc other fixes that have accumulated

    Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rzhang/linux
    
    Pull thermal management updates from Zhang Rui:
     "We have a lot of SOC changes and a few thermal core fixes this time.
    
      The biggest change is about exynos thermal driver restructure.  The
      patch set adds TMU (Thermal management Unit) driver support for
      exynos5440 platform.  There are 3 instances of the TMU controllers so
      necessary cleanup/re-structure is done to handle multiple thermal
      zone.
    
      The next biggest change is the introduction of the imx thermal driver.
      It adds the imx thermal support using Temperature Monitor (TEMPMON)
      block found on some Freescale i.MX SoCs.  The driver uses syscon
      regmap interface to access TEMPMON control registers and calibration
      data, and supports cpufreq as the cooling device.
    
      Highlights:
    
       - restructure exynos thermal driver.
    
       - introduce new imx thermal driver.
    
       - fix a bug in thermal core, which powers on the fans unexpectedly
         after resume from suspend"

    drm/nouveau/therm: remove some confusion introduced by therm_mode
    
    The kernel message "[  PTHERM][0000:01:00.0] Thermal management: disabled"
    is misleading as it actually means "fan management: disabled".
    
    This patch fixes both the source and the message to improve readability.
