    dt-bindings: crypto: Let STM32 define Ux500 CRYP
    
    This adds device tree bindings for the Ux500 CRYP block
    as a compatible in the STM32 CRYP bindings.
    
    The Ux500 CRYP binding has been used for ages in the kernel
    device tree for Ux500 but was never documented, so fill in
    the gap by making it a sibling of the STM32 CRYP block,
    which is what it is.
    
    The relationship to the existing STM32 CRYP block is pretty
    obvious when looking at the register map, and I have written
    patches to reuse the STM32 CRYP driver on the Ux500.
    
    The two properties added are DMA channels and power domain.
    Power domains are a generic SoC feature and the STM32 variant
    also has DMA channels.

    soc: qcom: rpmpd: Add a Power domain driver to model corners
    
    The Power domains for corners just pass the performance state set by the
    consumers to the RPM (Remote Power manager) which then takes care
    of setting the appropriate voltage on the corresponding rails to
    meet the performance needs.
    
    We add all power domain data needed on msm8996 here. This driver can easily
    be extended by adding data for other qualcomm SoCs as well.

    arm64: dts: renesas: r8a779{65,80,90}: Add IPMMU devices nodes
    
    Add IPMMU device nodes for the R-Car M3-N (r8a77965),
    V3H (r8a77980) and E3 (r8a77990) SoCs.
    
    * The r8a77965 IPMMU is quite similar to r8a7796 however VP0
      has been added and PV1 has been removed. Also the IMSSTR
      bit assignment has been reworked.
    
    * The r8a77980 IPMMU is quite similar to r8a77970 however VC0
      has been added. The IMSSTR bit assignment has also been
      reworked. Power domains are also quite different however the
      the documentation is rather unclear about this topic.
    
      Until we know better VC0 gets assigned to R8A77980_PD_ALWAYS_ON.
    
    * The r8a77990 IPMMU is similar to r8a77995. Power domains are
      however different and the public documentation is still unclear.
    
      Based on preliminary information from the hardware team the R-Car E3
      SoC comes with an IPMMU-VP0 device in an Always-on power domain and
      the IPMMU-VC0 is placed as expected in the A3VC power domain.

    Support for any other power domain controlled by GPC is not present, and
    can be added at some later point.
    
    Testing of this code was done against a PCIe driver.
