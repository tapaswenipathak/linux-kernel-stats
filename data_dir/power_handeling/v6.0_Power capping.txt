    Pull power management and ACPI updates from Rafael Wysocki:
     "From the number of commits perspective, the biggest items are ACPICA
      and cpufreq changes with the latter taking the lead (over 50 commits).
    
      On the cpufreq front, there are many cleanups and minor fixes in the
      core and governors, driver updates etc.  We also have a new cpufreq
      driver for Mediatek MT8173 chips.
    
      ACPICA mostly updates its debug infrastructure and adds a number of
      fixes and cleanups for a good measure.
    
      The Operating Performance Points (OPP) framework is updated with new
      DT bindings and support for them among other things.
    
      We have a few updates of the generic power domains framework and a
      reorganization of the ACPI device enumeration code and bus type
      operations.
    
      And a lot of fixes and cleanups all over.
    
      Included is one branch from the MFD tree as it contains some
      PM-related driver core and ACPI PM changes a few other commits are
      based on.
    
      Specifics:
    
       - ACPICA update to upstream revision 20150818 including method
         tracing extensions to allow more in-depth AML debugging in the
         kernel and a number of assorted fixes and cleanups (Bob Moore, Lv
         Zheng, Markus Elfring).
    
       - ACPI sysfs code updates and a documentation update related to AML
         method tracing (Lv Zheng).
    
       - ACPI EC driver fix related to serialized evaluations of _Qxx
         methods and ACPI tools updates allowing the EC userspace tool to be
         built from the kernel source (Lv Zheng).
    
       - ACPI processor driver updates preparing it for future introduction
         of CPPC support and ACPI PCC mailbox driver updates (Ashwin
         Chaugule).
    
       - ACPI interrupts enumeration fix for a regression related to the
         handling of IRQ attribute conflicts between MADT and the ACPI
         namespace (Jiang Liu).
    
       - Fixes related to ACPI device PM (Mika Westerberg, Srinidhi
         Kasagar).
    
       - ACPI device registration code reorganization to separate the
         sysfs-related code and bus type operations from the rest (Rafael J
         Wysocki).
    
       - Assorted cleanups in the ACPI core (Jarkko Nikula, Mathias Krause,
         Andy Shevchenko, Rafael J Wysocki, Nicolas Iooss).
    
       - ACPI cpufreq driver and ia64 cpufreq driver fixes and cleanups (Pan
         Xinhui, Rafael J Wysocki).
    
       - cpufreq core cleanups on top of the previous changes allowing it to
         preseve its sysfs directories over system suspend/resume (Viresh
         Kumar, Rafael J Wysocki, Sebastian Andrzej Siewior).
    
       - cpufreq fixes and cleanups related to governors (Viresh Kumar).
    
       - cpufreq updates (core and the cpufreq-dt driver) related to the
         turbo/boost mode support (Viresh Kumar, Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz).
    
       - New DT bindings for Operating Performance Points (OPP), support for
         them in the OPP framework and in the cpufreq-dt driver plus related
         OPP framework fixes and cleanups (Viresh Kumar).
    
       - cpufreq powernv driver updates (Shilpasri G Bhat).
    
       - New cpufreq driver for Mediatek MT8173 (Pi-Cheng Chen).
    
       - Assorted cpufreq driver (speedstep-lib, sfi, integrator) cleanups
         and fixes (Abhilash Jindal, Andrzej Hajda, Cristian Ardelean).
    
       - intel_pstate driver updates including Skylake-S support, support
         for enabling HW P-states per CPU and an additional vendor bypass
         list entry (Kristen Carlson Accardi, Chen Yu, Ethan Zhao).
    
       - cpuidle core fixes related to the handling of coupled idle states
         (Xunlei Pang).
    
       - intel_idle driver updates including Skylake Client support and
         support for freeze-mode-specific idle states (Len Brown).
    
       - Driver core updates related to power management (Andy Shevchenko,
         Rafael J Wysocki).
    
       - Generic power domains framework fixes and cleanups (Jon Hunter,
         Geert Uytterhoeven, Rajendra Nayak, Ulf Hansson).
    
       - Device PM QoS framework update to allow the latency tolerance
         setting to be exposed to user space via sysfs (Mika Westerberg).
    
       - devfreq support for PPMUv2 in Exynos5433 and a fix for an incorrect
         exynos-ppmu DT binding (Chanwoo Choi, Javier Martinez Canillas).
    
       - System sleep support updates (Alan Stern, Len Brown, SungEun Kim).
    
       - rockchip-io AVS support updates (Heiko Stuebner).
    
       - PM core clocks support fixup (Colin Ian King).
    
       - Power capping RAPL driver update including support for Skylake H/S
         and Broadwell-H (Radivoje Jovanovic, Seiichi Ikarashi).
    
       - Generic device properties framework fixes related to the handling
         of static (driver-provided) property sets (Andy Shevchenko).
    
       - turbostat and cpupower updates (Len Brown, Shilpasri G Bhat,
         Shreyas B Prabhu)"

    Pull power management fixes from Rafael Wysocki:
    
     - cpufreq regression fix from Bj√∏rn Mork restoring the pre-3.12
       behavior of the framework during system suspend/hibernation to avoid
       garbage sysfs files from being left behind in case of a suspend error
    
     - PNP regression fix to restore the correct states of devices after
       resume from hibernation broken in 3.12.  From Dmitry Torokhov.
    
     - cpuidle fix to prevent cpuidle device unregistration from crashing
       due to a NULL pointer dereference if cpuidle has been disabled from
       the kernel command line.  From Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk.
    
     - intel_idle fix for the C6 state definition on Intel Avoton/Rangeley
       processors from Arne Bockholdt.
    
     - Power capping framework fix to make the energy_uj sysfs attribute
       work in accordance with the documentation.  From Srinivas Pandruvada.
    
     - epoll fix to make it ignore the EPOLLWAKEUP flag if the kernel has
       been compiled with CONFIG_PM_SLEEP unset (in which case that flag
       should not have any effect).  From Amit Pundir.
    
     - cpufreq fix to prevent governor sysfs files from being lost over
       system suspend/resume in some (arguably unusual) situations.  From
       Viresh Kumar.
