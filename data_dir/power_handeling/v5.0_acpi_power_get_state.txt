    ACPI: power: Use u8 as the power resource state data type
    
    Use u8 as the data type for representing the state of an ACPI
    power resource.
    
    It is s not necessary to use int for that and because subsequent
    changes are going to use ACPI_POWER_RESOURCE_STATE_UNKNOWN, it is
    better to adjust the data type so that the "unknown" state is
    represented by the "all ones" value.
    
    While at it, clean up acpi_power_get_state() somewhat.
    
    No intentional functional impact.

    Pull ACPI and power management fixes from Rafael Wysocki:
    
     - intel_pstate fix for misbehavior after system resume if sysfs
       attributes are set in a specific way before the corresponding suspend
       from Dirk Brandewie.
    
     - A recent intel_pstate fix has no effect if unsigned long is 32-bit,
       so fix it up to cover that case as well.
    
     - The s3c64xx cpufreq driver was not updated when the index field of
       struct cpufreq_frequency_table was replaced with driver_data, so
       update it now.  From Charles Keepax.
    
     - The Kconfig help text for ACPI_BUTTON still refers to
       /proc/acpi/event that has been dropped recently, so modify it to
       remove that reference.  From Krzysztof Mazur.
    
     - A Lan Tianyu's change adds a missing mutex unlock to an error code
       path in acpi_resume_power_resources().
    
     - Some code related to ACPI power resources, whose very purpose is
       questionable to put it lightly, turns out to cause problems to happen
       during testing on real systems, so remove it completely (we may
       revisit that in the future if there's a compelling enough reason).
       From Rafael J Wysocki and Aaron Lu.

    ACPI / power: Release resource_lock after acpi_power_get_state() return error
    
    In acpi_resume_power_resources() resource_lock should be released
    when acpi_power_get_state() fails and before passing to next power
    resource on the list.

    ACPI: Get the device power state in the course of scanning device
    
    Get the device power state in the course of scanning device if the device
    power flag is power_managable. i.e. The device has the _PSx/_PRx object.
    
    At the same time before the drivers/acpi/power module is loaded, there is no
    relation between acpi_power_resource and acpi device. So the first parameter
    of acpi_power_get_state is changed to acpi_handle.
