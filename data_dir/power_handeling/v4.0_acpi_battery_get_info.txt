    ACPI: battery: remove redundant old_present check on insertion
    
    On removal battery_present changes from 1 to 0 after calling
    acpi_battery_get_status() and battery->update_time is set to 0
    before returning.
    
    On insertion battery_present changes from 0 to 1 after calling
    acpi_battery_get_status() and acpi_battery_get_info() is called
    because battery->update_time is 0.
    
    The old_present condition is therefore redundant.
    
    This was added in the commit below when there was a path without
    sysfs that would skip getting the newly inserted battery info.
    
    commit 50b178512b7d ("Newly inserted battery might differ from one
    just removed, so update of battery info fields is required.")

    ACPI: battery: Fix CONFIG_ACPI_SYSFS_POWER=n
    
    Disabling CONFIG_ACPI_SYSFS_POWER changes the behaviour of
    acpi_battery_update().  It will call acpi_battery_get_info()
    even if the battery is not present.  I haven't noticed this
    causing any problem, but it does look like a bad idea.
