    drm/exynos: mixer: Fix enabling of the runtime power management
    
    Runtime power management is essential for the Exynos Mixer driver
    operation. It should be enabled before adding its DRM component, because
    in some cases (when deferred probe takes place due to the IOMMU
    availability) the DRM driver might be initialized directly from the
    Mixer's component_add() call, what results in starting the driver
    operation without enabling the runtime power management.

    HID: i2c-hid: Remove runtime power management
    
    Runtime power management in i2c-hid brings lots of issues, such as:
    - When transitioning from display manager to desktop session, i2c-hid
    was closed and opened, so the device was set to SLEEP and ON in a short
    period. Vendors confirmed that their devices can't handle fast ON/SLEEP
    command because Windows doesn't have this behavior.
    
    - When rebooting, i2c-hid was closed, and the driver core put the device
    back to full power before shutdown. This behavior also triggers a quick
    SLEEP and ON commands that some devices can't handle, renders an
    unusable touchpad after reboot.
    
    - Most importantly, my power meter reports little to none energy saving
    when i2c-hid is runtime suspended.
    
    So let's remove runtime power management since there is no actual
    benefit.

    mfd: arizona: Disable interrupts during resume
    
    Runtime power management does not function during system suspend but the
    Arizona devices need to use runtime power management to power up the device
    in order to handle interrupts. Try to avoid interrupts firing during
    resume by disabling the primary IRQ before interrupts are reenabled on
    resume and only reenabling it again during main resume.
    
    The goal is to avoid issues in the situation where an interrupt is asserted
    during resume (eg, due to it being the wake source) and the interrupt
    handling gets scheduled prior to the device being able to handle runtime
    PM.

    drivers/misc/isl29020.c: ambient light sensor
    
    The LS driver will read the latest Lux measurement based upon the light
    brightness and will report the LUX output through sysfs interface.
    
    This hardware isn't quite the same as the ISL29003 so has a different
    driver.
